# omori-randomizer
A project that focuses on randomizing various elements in the indie RPG, OMORI.

Currently randomized: Non-key items, weapons, and charms
Shop inventories and prices
Battle drops

How to use:

Rph's OneLoader is a prerequisite to be able to load in the
randomizer

Unzip the zipped folder containing the randomizeralpha folder
into the mods folder in your OMORI directory

Remove/delete the zipped folder afterward or an error will occur
when launching the game

In the newly unzipped folder, run omorirandomizer.exe

By default, the directory should be set to the randomizeralpha
folder.
If this is not the case for whatever reason, you are able to
click the Browse button to locate and select it

As long as the correct folder is selected, clicking the Randomize
button will now commence randomization

In less than a minute, you should see a "Randomization Complete!"
message. You may now close the randomizer window.

Launch the game and have fun!
Helpful tip for people who want to easily revert back to
the unmodded game: In OMORI's launch options, type in '--no-mods'
before launching the game
