How to use:

Rph's OneLoader is a prerequisite to be able to load in the
randomizer.

Unzip the zipped folder containing the randomizeralpha folder
into the mods folder in your OMORI directory.

Remove/delete the zipped folder afterward or an error will occur
when launching the game.

In the newly unzipped folder, run omorirandomizer.exe.

By default, the directory should be set to the randomizeralpha
folder.
If this is not the case for whatever reason, you are able to
click the Browse button to locate and select it.

There are several randomization options:
Randomize Items/Weapons/Charms - Places all non-key items, weapons, and charms in the same pool to be randomly reassigned to different locations.

Randomize Party Skills - Places most non-follow up skills in the same pool and randomly reassigns them. Level up, weapon melon, and special interaction skills are all affected.

Randomize Inventory on Load* - When loading a game, removes all items and equipment other than Omori's Shiny Knife and Aubrey's Stuffed Toy and gives you three random items/weapons/charms. Recommended for use on a save immediately after going to Basil's House once he's missing.

Randomize Already Learned Skills on Load* - When loading a game, removes all learned skills other than Guard for each character and gives them randomly reassigned skills up to Level 3. Recommended for use on a save immediately after going to Basil's House once he's missing.

*Only happens on first load. Once a loaded randomized file is saved again, it will not be randomized again on subsequent loads. **Do not check these options when starting from a new game if you plan on saving as randomization will occur again the next time you load that file.**

As long as the correct folder is selected, clicking the Randomize
button will now commence randomization.

In less than a minute, you should see a "Randomization Complete!"
message. You may now close the randomizer window.

Launch the game and have fun!
Helpful tip for people who want to easily revert back to
the unmodded game: In OMORI's launch options, type in '--no-mods'
before launching the game.
